                My name is Lewis Menelaws, I am a 27 year old software engineer who has a software agency in Ontario, Canada. I have been 
                programming professionally for 5-6 years and am looking to help inspire you to learn code. ðŸ˜ŠLewis I want to thank you a thousand times for this video. I am learning html, css and javascript all at the same 
                time and till now I found it very time consuming and frustrating. Anyways I took some notes from your roadmap, subscribed to your newsletter 
                and will now start my journey as a full stack dev
